            "question": "What Is the Ethereum Network? Explain.",
            "answer": "Ethereum is a second-generation distributed ledger technology that builds upon the bitcoin network. It was first launched in 2015, and it has continued to grow from there. It is an open-source public distributed ledger technology. Technically, it is also an operating system with key features such as smart contracts, transaction-based state transitions, and virtual machines."
        },
        {
            "question": "Who Is the Founder of Ethereum?",
            "answer": "There are two original authors of Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Is EVM?",
            "answer": "EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is a decentralized virtual machine capable of handling scripts using the public nodes network. It is also Turing complete and utilizes Gas as an internal pricing mechanism."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Is Ether?",
            "answer": "Ether is best defined as a crypto-fuel(token) that powers the Ethereum network. It powers the smart contracts and provides the nodes an incentive to validate the Ethereum blockchain blocks. Once a block is validated, 5 Ether is released to nodes that took part in the process."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which Consensus Algorithm Does Ethereum Use?",
            "answer": "Right now, Ethereum utilizes Proof-of-Work as its consensus algorithm. Ethereum network is in the process of changing its consensus algorithm to a more environmentally friendly consensus method Proof-of-Stake (PoS)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Are Smart Contracts?",
            "answer": "Smart contracts are like legal documents in code. It is a computer protocol that can be used as a digital verification process or enforce negotiations between parties. Smart contracts are also transparent and automated. In short, it offers a conflict-free approach to deals, agreements, and disputes."
        },
        {
            "question": "Explain How Proof-Of-Work (Pow) Works?",
            "answer": "Proof-of-Work is a consensus algorithm that requires work from miners to validate the transactions. The work is generated by solving complex computational problems using hardware. It is not environmentally friendly as it requires a lot of electricity to run the hardware, which in turn solves those complex computational problems."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Is Dapps?",
            "answer": "dApp stands for decentralized application. These applications are created to take advantage of blockchain technologies. dApps offer many benefits, including being decentralized and open source. It also follows protocols and incentivizes nodes that take part in the functioning of the dApp.<br/>Ethereum is a popular blockchain network for dApps as it offers the right ecosystem for developers to create real-world dApps."
        },
        {
            "question": "Tell Us About the Type of Ethereum Networks That Exist.",
            "answer": " There are three types:<br/> Private Network<br/> Test Network, e.g., Rinkeby and Ropsten<br/> Live Network, i.e., the main Network"
        },
        {
            "question": "Tell Us About Smart Contract Use Cases?",
            "answer": "There are many smart contract use cases. For instance, it can be used in real estate where a seller can set up a smart contract to sell properly. The property can be transferred to the buyer once he transfers the property amount."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Is Metamask?",
            "answer": "MetaMask is a popular browser-based Ethereum wallet that can be used to interact with the dApps on the Ethereum network."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Is Truffle?",
            "answer": "Truffle is a popular testing and development environment for Ethereum. It also offers an asset pipeline, which makes it handle Ethereum based projects. With it, a developer can create smart contracts, dApps, do automated testing, configure and build pipelines, and so on. It is a perfect framework for developers using Ethereum."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is the User’s Private Key Used to Sign Transactions?",
            "answer": "Yes."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Is Geth?",
            "answer": "Geth is a command-line interface used when running a full Ethereum node. It’s one of the best blockchain tools out there."
        },
        {
            "question": "What Is Remix?",
            "answer": "Remix is a useful online tool that can be used to deploy, test and develop smart contracts. By using it, developers can quickly test their smart contracts."
