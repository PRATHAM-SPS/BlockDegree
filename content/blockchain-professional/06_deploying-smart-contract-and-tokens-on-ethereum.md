### Create Genesis File on Notepad (json Format)
<div class="precode">~/blockchain/genesis.json</div>

```json
{
	"config": {
    "chainId": 989899,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0
	},
	"difficulty": "200",
	"gasLimit": "99999999999999999",
	"alloc": {
	}
}
```

### Start your blockchain
<div class="precode">shell</div>

```console
user:/$ cd ~/blockchain
user:~/blockchain$ geth –datadir=./chaindata init genesis.json
user:~/blockchain$ geth –datadir ./chaindata --networkid 989899
```


### Attach the Geth console
Open a new command prompt and run the command below
<div class="precode">shell</div>

```console
user:/$ cd ~/blockchain
user:~/blockchain$ geth attach
```

Create  your own Account
<div class="precode">geth console</div>

```console
> personal.newAccount()
> miner.start()
> miner.stop()
> eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase)
  25000000000000000000
> web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase))
  15  
```

The XDC-E smart contract is available on the following link. Copy the smart contract.

### Write Your Smart Contract on Remix Compiler

After that copy on ABI (Web3deploy)

ABI is the binary interface of the application. ABI is an interface between two software modules, one of which is often at the machine code level. In Ethereum, basically, you can encode Solidity contracts for EVM and, conversely, read data from transactions.

Copy of the ->var Coincontract =web3.eth.contract………. etc.

Copy of the ->var coin= coinContract.new …………. Etc.

After that your submitted contract is created

### Calling our Smart Contract

Now that our smart contract is deployed on our private Ethereum Blockchain, we can invoke our smart contract. You will require two information of the smart contracts:
1. The ABI definition
2. The contract address

Contract is deployed

With that you have deployed your smart contract to your own private Ethereum network!
