## Cloud Computing Service Models:-

#### Cloud solutions come in three primary service models: :-

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

## . IaaS:-

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) hosts infrastructure on the public cloud and private cloud instead of in a traditional on-premises data center. The infrastructure is delivered to customers on demand while being fully managed by the service provide
 - IaaS gives users access to storage, networking, servers, and other computing resources via the cloud. While the user is still responsible for managing their applications, data, middleware, etc., IaaS provides automated and scalable environments that provide a high degree of control and flexibility for the user. For example, many businesses use IaaS to support workload spikes during busy seasons (like holidays)
 
 - The IaaS technology helps the users to avoid the cost and complexity of purchasing and managing their own physical servers. Every resource of IaaS is offered as an individual service component and the users only have to use the particular one they need. The cloud service provider manages the IaaS infrastructure while the users can concentrate on installing, configuring and managing their software.
 
 ### What are the Benefits of Infrastructure-as-a-Service?
 
 - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) can be more efficient for an enterprise than owning and managing its own infrastructure. New applications can be tested with an IaaS provider instead of acquiring the infrastructure for the test.

#### Other advantages of infrastructure-as-a-service include:

    -  Continuity and disaster recovery  Cloud service in different locations allows access to applications and data during a disaster or outage.
    -  Faster scaling  Quickly scale up and down resources according to application demand in all categories of cloud computing.
    - Core focus  IaaS allows enterprises to focus more on core business activities instead of IT infrastructure and computing resources.

 
### Popular IaaS providers include:-
a. Amazon Web Services (AWS)

b. Microsoft Azure

c. Google Compute Engine (GCE)

d. IBM

e. Ali Cloud.

## 2. PaaS:-

- In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, developers essentially rent everything they need to build an application, relying on a cloud provider for development tools, infrastructure, and operating systems. This is one of the three service models of cloud computing. 

- PaaS vastly simplifies web application development; from the developer's perspective, all backend management takes place behind the scenes. Although PaaS has some similarities with serverless computing, there are many critical differences between them.

- This service layer is primarily geared towards developers and operations professionals. Service providers rent out cloud-based platforms for users to develop and deliver applications. In other words, PaaS provides a framework that makes it easier and more efficient to build, customize, and deploy applications.

## 3. SaaS:-

- SaaS is a method of software delivery that allows data to be accessed from any device with an internet connection and a web browser. In this web-based model, software vendors host and maintain the servers, databases, and the code that makes up an application.

- The cloud-based model is so common now that more than 60% of software seekers who call Software Advice only want web-based products less than 2% specifically ask for on-premise software.

### What is the history of SaaS?
- In a 1961 speech to MIT students, John McCarthy, a renowned computer scientist that won the Turing award for his work in artificial intelligence (AI), famously said, computation may someday be organized as a public utility. In other words, the concept of cloud computing began as a shared resource of computing power.

- While the idea has been around for some time, the web-based technology required to support SaaS matured in the late 1990s. That's when companies such as Salesforce which was founded specifically to create cloud software began offering traditional enterprise solutions, such as customer relationship management (CRM), through a SaaS model.

#### Popular SaaS options include email and customer relationship management software.:- 

a. Office365

b. Gsuite

c. IndSoft System Hosted Email Services

d. SalesForce
