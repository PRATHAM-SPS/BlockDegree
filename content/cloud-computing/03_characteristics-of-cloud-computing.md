## Characteristics of cloud computing:-

#### 1. On-demand self-service:-

- Users can access computing services via the cloud when they need to without interaction from the service provider. The computing services should be fully on-demand so that users have control and agility to meet their evolving needs

#### 2. Broad network access:-
 - Cloud computing services are widely available via the network through usersï¿½ preferred tools 
(e.g., laptops, desktops, smartphones, etc.).

#### 3. Resource pooling:-

- One of the most attractive elements of cloud computing is the pooling of resources to deliver computing services at scale. Resources, such as storage, memory, processing, and network bandwidth, are pooled and assigned to multiple consumers based on demand.

#### 4. Rapid elasticity:-

- Successful resource allocation requires elasticity. Resources must be assigned accurately and quickly with the ability to absorb significant increases and decreases in demand without service interruption or quality degradation.

#### 5. Measured service:-

- Utility model empowers cloud computing services to be measured and metered. This measurement allows the service provider (and consumer) to track usage and gauge costs according to their demand on resources
