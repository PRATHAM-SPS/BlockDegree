## Benefits of using the cloud for your business:-
- *There are many potential advantages to adopting cloud-based solutions for your business. Depending on your business and data needs, migrating to a cloud environment can result in the following benefits:*

#### 1. Cost Savings:-

- Although the initial price tag for migrating to the cloud can give some businesses sticker shock, there are attractive opportunities for ROI. Operating on the cloud typically means adopting a pay-as-you-go model, which means you no longer have to pay for IT you're not using (whether that's storage, bandwidth, etc.).

- Plus, cloud solutions are particularly affordable for smaller businesses who don't have the capital to build out and manage their own IT infrastructures. Greater efficiencies and economies of scale mean more money in your pocket in the long run.

#### 2. Reliability:-

- A managed cloud platform is generally much more reliable than an in-house IT infrastructure, with fewer instances of downtime or service interruptions. Most providers offer 24/7 support and over 99.9% availability. With backups for their backups, you can rest assured your data and applications will be available whenever you need them.

#### 3. Mobility:-

- The cloud brings a level of portability unheard of with traditional IT delivery. By managing your data and software on the cloud, employees can access necessary information and communicate with each other whenever and wherever they want from their laptop, smartphone, or other Internet-connected devices.

- Cloud-based solutions open up opportunities for more remote work and higher productivity and efficiency as everyone is assured access to the same updated information at the touch of a button.


#### Essentials user should know before deployment of cloud computing:-

- A user should know some parameters by which he can go for the cloud computing services. The parameters are as follows: 

   1. Cloud Data Integrity: It is a measure to ensure integrity like the data is accurate, complete and reasonable. 
   
   2. Compliance: user should make sure that proper rules and regulations are followed while implementing the structure. 
   
   3. Loss of data: user should know about the provisions that are provided in case of loss of data so that backup and recovery can be possible. 
   
   4. Business continuity plans: user should think about does the cloud services provide him uninterrupted data resources. 
   
   5. Uptime: user should know about the uptime the cloud computing platform provides and how helpful it is for the business. 
   
   6. Data storage costs: user should find out about the cost which you have to pay before you go for cloud computing.
   
 #### How is the Cloud Computing different from Primitive Client-Server Architecture?
 
 - The primitive Client-Server architecture is a one-to-one communication between only two physical machines namely Client machine and Server machine (datacenter). Whereas the cloud computing, infrastructure is similar at the client side but varies at server-side. The server-side contains a main Cloud Controller that forwards the request to its worker machines known as Nodes. These nodes are a grid computing machines that dedicate all its resources to process application. These nodes are maintained in clusters. So a cloud computing infrastructure is quite complicated on server side that processes all the requests from clients and send the result back.
 
 #### What is the difference between Traditional Datacenters and Cloud?
 
   - Cost of compute in traditional datacenter is much higher, due to the fact that all computing resources are billed as per Block, which mean many time you would be billing for resources which you are not using. In case of cloud computing you actually use and pay for resources which you use, That is Pay as your Use Model. 
   
   
    It gets scaled when the demand increases. Most of the cost is being spent on the maintenance being performed on the datacenters, whereas cloud platform requires minimum maintenance and not very expert hand to handle them.



#### What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?

  -  Scalability is a characteristic of cloud computing through which increasing workload can be handled by increasing in proportion the amount of resource capacity. It allows the architecture to provide on demand resources if the requirement is being raised by the traffic. Whereas, elasticity is being one of the characteristic provide the concept of commissioning and decommissioning of large amount of resource capacity dynamically. It is measured by the speed by which the resources are coming on demand and the usage of the resources.
  
#### Factors involves in cloud:-

- Cloud data center doesn't require experts to operate it, but it requires skilled people to see the maintenance, maintain the workloads and to keep the track of the traffic. The labor cost is 6% of the total cost to operate the cloud data center. Power distribution and cooling of the datacenter cost 20% of the total cost. Computing cost is at the end and is the highest as it is where lots of resources and installation has to be done. It costs the maximum left percentage.

#### What is the Security aspects provided with cloud?
- Security is one of the major aspects which come with any application and service used by the user. Companies or organizations remain much more concerned with the security provided with the cloud. There are many levels of security which has to be provided within cloud environment such as: 

#### 1. Identity Management: 
It authorizes the application service or hardware component to be used by authorized users. 
#### 2. Access Control: 
Permissions has to be provided to the users so that they can control the access of other users who are entering the in the cloud environment. 
#### 3. Authorization and Authentication: 
provision should be made to allow the authorized and authenticated people only to access and change the applications and data.

### Calculation of cloud charges
-  Cloud computing provides the services to the organizations so they can run their applications and install them on the cloud. Virtualization is used to deploy the cloud computing models as it provides a hidden layer between the user and the physical layer of the system. The cloud services are measured in terms of use. Pay as much as you use that can be on the basis of hours or months or years. Cloud services allow users to pay for only what they use and according to the demand the charges or the prices gets increased.
