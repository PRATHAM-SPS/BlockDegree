##How to Deploy Cloud:-

- Cloud computing provides a reliable and cost- effective setting for deploying web applications. However, choosing and configuring an appropriate cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), e.g., the appropriate database and computing instances and acceptable service rates, is a daunting task. The task is also challenging when trying to optimize the IaaS for conflicting objectives such as performance and cost. Furthermore, due to lack of understanding of the pricing model and the cloud IaaS, a cloud consumer may pay more than necessary or may not fully utilize the purchased resources.

- Selecting a provider whose strongest modules support your top business goals will help to maximize ROI and adoption. Strategic sourcing include spend analysis, sourcing, contract management and supplier management. While there are multiple providers each with their own set of specialties, We suggest you start with a niche provider who can partner with you in your cloud adoption journey. 

- Based on our studies conducted for multiple providers, We selected IndSoft Systems to start our Cloud journey. We were able to engage with IndSoftï¿½s Technical team right from the start and choose the right solutions for deployment. They not only customized solutions as per our requirements, but were helped us out as our extended technical team. Within 3 month of our deployment, We were able to achieve performance parameters which we had set before we started our cloud journey. They can be reached at http://cloud.indsoft.net
