Many people think that bitcoin equates to blockchain. The confusion probably stems from the fact that bitcoin is the most well known cryptocurrency in the market today and blockchain is relatively still a mystery to most people.

Blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology. Similar to any other technologies that we have seen, like internet, or AI, blockchain is a tool that could be implemented to solve certain problems in organisations and society. In this blockchain technology, it comprises of various elements: cryptocurrency, nodes, consensus algorithm and cryptographic hashes etc.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is the first cryptocurrency to be created in the blockchain space. At this point in time, most people will associate bitcoin as a digital gold. To put things into perspective, there are currently more than 2000 cryptocurrencies being powered by various blockchain technologies. And bitcoin is just one of them.

### Key differences between blockchain and bitcoin
We will now explore in more detail on how bitcoin and blockchain differ. In general, we could categorise the key differences between bitcoin and blockchain.

#### Properties and usage
__Bitcoin__: The main aim of bitcoin is to enable and simplify transactions without the interventions of intermediaries, such as banks and governments. The advantage of using bitcoin over traditional transfer method is the potential reduction in transaction time and cost. This property has allowed bitcoin to be used for cross-border transactions, peer-to-peer payment and cryptocurrency trading. However, the limited scope of bitcoin has seen little use cases beyond those three.

__Blockchain__: Over the years, the blockchain technology has evolved from the distributed ledger use for bitcoin. Blockchain has enabled direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need of a trusted intermediary in a low-cost, safe and secure environment. The development of blockchain has allowed more sophisticated data to be store along with the transaction. This means that blockchain could be used to track the transfer of various items, from currencies, to property rights to commodities.  This means that blockchain technology could be adapted to cater to various industries, e.g. insurance, supply chain and even government agencies

#### Technological components
__Bitcoin__: Bitcoin is a public blockchain. Bitcoin users in general maintain their privacy and anonymity as only their digital wallet public address is known. The transactions recorded in the bitcoin ledger consists of cryptic numeric codes that people canâ€™t understand.

__Blockchain__:  Blockchain can be public, private, or hybrid. Depending on the requirements of the users or organisations, different type of blockchain technology will be used. When implementing blockchain technology, organisations will need to understand how the integration of blockchain technology can comply with the existing requirements and practices.

In most cases, the identity of the users who are involved in the transactions need to be known. On this account, industry practices like know your customers and anti money laundering will need to be integrated to the blockchain solution. Therefore, the transactions recorded in the blockchain ledger are designed to be understood by the various business units.
